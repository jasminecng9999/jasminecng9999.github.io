    <p class="bio">Hello, I'm Jasmine! Welcome to my website where you can learn about my academic interests, and past projects! Currently, I am a M.Eng student at Cornell University studying Operations Research Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. During this program, I am working with The Home Depot to analyze and model their e-commerce dataset. In the upcoming summer, I will be working with Nestle USA as a Digital Analytics Intern.
    Here is a rundown of my passion, and past work experience:</p>

  <h1>My Passion</h1>
</div>
<p>I am consumer obsessed. My passion in data science lies within the ability to understand people
  and their interactions to products, such as website features or in e-commerce applications.
  Here are my four favorite experiences so far that developed this passion of mine.</p>

<ol type="1">
  <li>
    I was the product owner and solutions architect to a Natural Language Processing toolkit I built for 
    Nestle USA that had topic modelling and sentiment analysis capabilities. The ability to classify and 
    label textual data such as product reviews and social media posts, I was able to drive business 
    decisions with my model. For example, I was able to advise brand managers on certain characteristics 
    of the product consumers appreciate and what they like to see change. Another use case was being able 
    to advise the marketing team on what kind of content users engage the most with on a social media platform.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    I worked with the Home Depot team to improve the traffic and conversion rate of their online home depot site.
    By analyzing site activities and clickstream data, I was able to develop a recommendation engine to
    suggest landing page destinations so that the probability of the customer's conversion rate increases by 22%.
  </li>
  
  
  <li>I built a recommendation model during my data science internship at Aretove Technologies,
    predicting the next products customers would buy. I conducted customer journey mapping to analyze customer
    buying patterns. I also clustered customers with several defining features to recommend the likeliest product
    that would be ordered per customer segment.</li>

  <li>Iâ€™ve tracked metrics such as click through rate to gauge user preferences on varied web features
    during my internship at 24/7 TEACH. By A/B testing, I obtained numerical evidence of which design variation
    users would engage with more, which was particularly helpful when communicating design choices to the client.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I am hoping my future experiences will align with my academic interest in utilizing my software skillsets in R,
  Python, SQL, Web-programming languages, and my knowledge of operations research methods and statistics
  in the context of consumer experience and e-commerce business applications. Feel free to contact me via email
